## WIT
WIT (When I Type) is a keyboarding system designed to simplify keyboard usage for the visually impaired.  It works by moving the emphasis from memorizing key locations on a keyboard to memorizing patterns.

### How does it work
WIT works by first allowing the user to select ten different keys on a keyboard to use to type. Then, based on the order each of these keys are pressed, different actions will occur. The most basic usage is typing out characters into a text editor, it will be expanded to things such as better browser usability or music player enhancements.
